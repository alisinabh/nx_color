Colorspace conversion in Elixir Nx.

With NxColor you can convert images (to be precise, pixels) between various colorspaces
like RGB, CMYK or CIE-Lab.

Since this is implemented using Elixir Nx, It should be really fast.

## Installation

NxColor can be installed by adding `nx_color` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nx_color, "~> 0.0.0-dev"}
  ]
end
```
